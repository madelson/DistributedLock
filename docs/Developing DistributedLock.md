# Developing DistributedLock

## Installing back-ends for testing

DistributedLock has a variety of back-ends; to be able to develop and run tests against all of them you'll need to install a good amount of software.

### Azure

For the Azure back-end, [Azurite](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azurite) is used for local development. See [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azurite?tabs=visual-studio%2Cblob-storage#install-azurite) for how to install.

### MySQL

The MySQL driver covers both MySQL and MariaDB; so we'll need to install both.

#### MariaDB

The MariaDB installer can be downloaded [here](https://mariadb.org/download/?t=mariadb&p=mariadb&os=windows&cpu=x86_64&pkg=msi&m=acorn).

After downloading, you'll need to enable the performance_schema which is used by DistributedLock's tests. You can do this by adding the following to your my.ini/my.cnf file (C:\Program Files\MariaDB {version}\data\my.ini on windows):

```ini
# activates the performance_schema tables which are needed by DistributedLock tests
performance_schema=ON
```

After doing this, restart MariaDB (on Windows, do this in the Services app).

Next, create the `distributed_lock` database and a user for the tests to run as:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE distributed_lock;
CREATE USER 'DistributedLock'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<password>';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON distributed_lock.* TO 'DistributedLock'@'localhost';
GRANT SELECT ON performance_schema.* TO 'DistributedLock'@'localhost';
```

Finally, add your username (DistributedLock) and password to `DistributedLock.Tests/credentials/mariadb.txt`, with the username on line 1 and the password on line 2.

#### MySQL

You can install MySQL from [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/). Run on port 3307 to avoid conflicting with MariaDB.

Add your username and password to `DistributedLock.Tests/credentials/mysql.txt`, with the username on line 1 and the password on line 2.

### Oracle

You can install Oracle from [here](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/oracle-database-software-downloads.html#db_free). It claims not to support Windows 11 Home, but it seems to install and work fine.

Add your username (e.g. SYSTEM) and password to `DistributedLock.Tests/credentials/oracle.txt`, with the username on line 1 and the password on line 2.

If the Oracle tests fail with `ORA-12541: TNS:no listener`, you may have to start the OracleOraDB21Home1TNSListener service in services.svc and/or restart the OracleServiceXE. After starting these it can take a few minutes for the DB to come online.

### Postgres

You can install Postgres from [here](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads).

In `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\<version>\data\postgresql.conf`, update `max_connections` to 200.

Add your username (e.g. postgres) and password to `DistributedLock.Tests/credentials/postgres.txt`, with the username on line 1 and the password on line 2.

### SQL Server

Download SQL developer edition from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads).

The tests connect via integrated security.

### Redis

Install Redis locally. On Windows, install it via WSL as described [here](https://developer.redis.com/create/windows/).

You do not need it running as a service: the tests will start and stop instances automatically.

### ZooKeeper

Download a ZooKeeper installation by going to [https://zookeeper.apache.org/](https://zookeeper.apache.org/)->Documentation->Release ...->Getting Started->Download->stable.

Extract the zip archive, and within it copy `zoo_sample.cfg` to `zoo.cfg`.

Add the full path of the extracted directory (the one containing README.md, bin, conf, etc) to `DistributedLock.Tests/credentials/zookeeper.txt` as a single line.

Also, install Java Development Kit (JDK) because ZooKeeper runs on Java.

### Etcd

The easiest way to run etcd tests locally is to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/):

```bash
# Run a single-node etcd cluster
docker run -d --name etcd \
  -p 2379:2379 \
  -p 2380:2380 \
  gcr.io/etcd-development/etcd:v3.6.1 \
  /usr/local/bin/etcd \
  --advertise-client-urls http://0.0.0.0:2379 \
  --listen-client-urls http://0.0.0.0:2379 \
  --data-dir /etcd-data

# Or run a 3-node cluster for more robust testing, this is already setup in EtcdClusterSetup
```

The tests will automatically start and stop etcd instances using Docker containers, so you don't need to have etcd running as a service for testing.
